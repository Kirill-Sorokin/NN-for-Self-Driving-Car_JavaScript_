# Self Driving Car(s)
Developed a system that emulates self driving cars using JavaScript. This also include the creation of a neural network using JavaScript with no libraries.

# Program Contains:
- Car driving mechanics/Physics
- Defining the road
- Artificial sensors
- Collision detection
- Simulating traffic
- Neural network
- Parallelisation
- Genetic algorithm

# Note(s):
JavaScript is not the best choice when doing Artificial Intelligence, but since I am not using any libraries, it doesn't really matter.
